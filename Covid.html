    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused far-reaching economic consequences[1] including the COVID-19 recession, the second largest global recession in recent history,[2] decreased business in the services sector during the COVID-19 lockdowns,[3] the 2020 stock market crash (which included the largest single-week stock market decline since the financial crisis of 2007–2008), the impact of COVID-19 on financial markets,[4][5][6][7][8][9] the 2021–2023 global supply chain crisis,[10] the 2021–2023 inflation surge, shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic including the 2020–present global chip shortage, panic buying,[11][12][13][14] and price gouging.[15] The pandemic led to governments providing an unprecedented amount of stimulus, and was also a factor in the 2021–2022 global energy crisis and 2022–2023 food crises.
        The pandemic affected worldwide economic activity, resulting in a 7% drop in global commercial commerce in 2020. Several demand and supply mismatches caused by the pandemic resurfaced throughout the recovery period in 2021 and 2022 and were spread internationally through trade.[16][17][18] During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses lost 25% of their revenue and 11% of their workforce, with contact-intensive sectors and SMEs being particularly heavily impacted. However, considerable policy assistance helped to avert large-scale bankruptcies, with just 4% of enterprises declaring for insolvency or permanently shutting at the time of the COVID-19 wave.[16]

        <p>COVID-19 virus has resulted in the lockdown of schools, offices, factories, temples, railway stations, and even the airspace. It is estimated that due to the lockdown, the Indian economy may face prolonged adverse impact. The paper is an attempt to ascertain the impact of lockdown on the Indian economy and explore future perspective. The study has addressed important issues like consumption expenditure, demand & supply, unemployment rate, purchasing power, financial market, etc. Under the given circumstances, the lockdown will cost India around USD 120 bn. The manufacturing and service sector has come to an abrupt stop and interrupted domestic supply chains. If this crisis continuous it will indirectly affect all economic sectors. The study has given suggestions as a learning curve which can be used by different stakeholder to improve the economic situation of the country and minimize negative effect of lockdown.

        <h3>Covid-19 effected lives of migrated workers </h3>

        <p>Regional migrant worker instruments such as the European Social Charter and the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers provide protection of social rights for migrant workers. The European Social Charter is a Council of Europe treaty that guarantees fundamental social and economic rights, with a specific emphasis on the protection of vulnerable persons, including migrants, whose social and economic rights must be guaranteed without discrimination. The European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers clarifies principal aspects of the legal situation of migrant workers, in particular recruitment, work permits, working conditions and dismissal among others.

            Companies are increasingly subject to non-financial reporting requirements and due diligence obligations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which often include disclosures on their performance. There are several high-profile examples of national legislation that specifically mandate human rights-related reporting and other positive legal duties, such as due diligence, including the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015, Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010, the French Corporate Duty of Vigilance Law 2017, the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains 2023 and the Norwegian Transparency Act 2022.
            
            Also, in 2021 the Netherlands submitted a Bill for Responsible and Sustainable International Business Conduct, and the European Commission announced its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). This Directive is likely to come into force between 2025 and 2027 and will make human rights and environmental due diligence mandatory for larger companies.
            
            These mandatory due diligence and disclosure laws require companies to publicly communicate their efforts to address actual and potential human rights impacts, including migrant labour abuses. Failure to comply with these obligations leads to real legal risk for companies.
