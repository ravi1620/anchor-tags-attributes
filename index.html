    <p>A sweeping new definition of long COVID could help affected people get recognition of their condition and improve diagnosis and treatment.

        The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine announced the definition for long COVID June 11.
        
        Previous definitions of long COVID have been all over the map, each with its own set of accepted symptoms, timelines and requirements for proof of infection (SN: 7/29/22).
        
        That lack of standardization “left many patients in the lurch without clear ability to be recognized for the condition that they had, with difficulty explaining to family and even to their caregivers,” says Harvey Fineberg, a public health expert who chaired the committee that drafted the definition. “We heard from literally hundreds of people experiencing long COVID about the challenges that they had in being heard, in gaining access to care and obtaining the care they needed.”</p>
        <h3>Economical loss</h3>
        <h4>Economical loss due to Corona</h4>
        <p>This study examines the patterns of losses in livelihoods, income and consumption expenditure among slum dwellers in Pune, a city in western India, two years after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A four-round panel dataset is used for this study with two rounds collected before (in-person in 2018 and 2019) and two rounds collected after (via phone interviews in 2020 and 2022) the start of the pandemic. Although at the macro-level gross domestic product and unemployment rates had started to recover by mid-2020, the results of this study show that recovery of livelihoods among individuals living just above subsistence level has been very limited and uneven even two years after the start of the pandemic. </p>
